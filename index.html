	<div align = justify><h1><div>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h1>
	<p>I'm from rural Arkansas and was the kid who dreamed of bigger and better things. I loved computers as a kid, but my family never had a remotely up-to-date computer until I was in my early twenties. I didn't gain much computer or internet experience until my early twenties, when I went to college.</p>
	<h1>Why are you taking this course?</h1>
	<p>After exploring the humanities in college and getting a masters degrees in history and another in teaching English as a second language, I realized that teaching wasn't the career I wanted to pursue and have tried for almost four years to find another career while working in retail. My hope is that taking this class will open new doors and create new opportunities for a new career and also present a new type of challenge.</p>
	<h1>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h1>
	<p>While managing a store for a local comic book retailer, I found myself needing to update my location's page from the company website. The standard procedure at the time was contacting one of the other managers and e-mailing him the information, but I felt that the turnaround time was too slow, so on a day off I asked him to show me how to update the page myself. I've done very basic HTML editing--enough to post new products and images of upcoming events on the store's page.</p>
	<h1>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h1>
	<p>I am working on a four-and-a-half year old Toshiba running Windows 7.</p>
	<h1>Anything else we should know?</h1>
	<p>A lot of this material is new to me, but I'm really excited to take this class and explore a new direction in my studies and career opportunities.</p></div>
